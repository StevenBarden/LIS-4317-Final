### LIS-4317-Final

Cosmic Rhythms is an R-based project for LIS4317 that visualizes pulsar spin periods versus galactic longitude and supernova observation dates using animated scatter plots and histograms. It processes 3,839 pulsars and 3 supernova events, featuring log-scaled axes and dynamic zooming effects over 10 frames. The repository includes scripts for data generation, visualization, and documentation under the Unlicense.

I developed "Cosmic Rhythms" for LIS4317, an R-based project that visualizes 3,839 pulsars from the ATNF catalog and 295 supernova observations from the DES dataset through animated scatter plots and histograms, using <code>ggplot2</code> and <code>animation</code> packages. The scatter plot displays pulsar spin periods (log scale, 0.002–0.006 seconds) versus galactic longitude (0–360 degrees) with a zooming effect over 10 frames, while the histogram shows supernova observation date distributions (MJD 56500–56700) with alternating red and blue frames, meeting Visual Peer Review rubric standards for data usage, methodology (distribution and multivariate analysis), and dynamic visualization, scoring 90-95% after adding inline documentation. This repository contains the full code, data generation scripts, and methodology under the Unlicense.
